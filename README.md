This repo is WIP (Work In Progress) as of now

Its aim is to provide a fully automated install of the KubeEdge components on 2 separate Google Cloud Engine (GCE) instances: 1 for CloudCore 
and for EdgeCore.

Currently working on a solution for [issue #2362](https://github.com/nholuongut/microk8s-kubeedge/issues/2362)
**[UPDATE]** Solution has been provided by the KubeEdge team: the initial security token must be obtained via 'keadm gettoken' on cloud side (after 'keadm init') 
and then used on edge side in keadm init 'via --token='. The latest version [microk8s-kubeedge.sh](https://github.com/nholuongut/microk8s-kubeedge/blob/main/sh/microk8s-kubeedge.sh) 
integrates this additional code.

If you wanna dig into the details [issue #2362](https://github.com/nholuongut/microk8s-kubeedge/issues/2362):

1. Structured log of failing execution is [here](https://github.com/nholuongut/microk8s-kubeedge/runs/1442253504) when you're signed in with your GitHub account
2. Raw log of failing execution is accessible via top right menu of the page linked in previous bullet : go to "..." > View Raw Logs
3. Shell script generating those logs is [microk8s-kubeedge.sh](https://github.com/nholuongut/microk8s-kubeedge/blob/main/sh/microk8s-kubeedge.sh)

For further details, please, check the official Git [repository of KubeEdge](https://github.com/nholuongut/microk8s-kubeedge)

Feel free to fork and reuse this repo already. But, rather come back until we get it to work to obtain complete version.
